## shipdemo
shipdemo emulates an echosounder storing RAW files in a directory, imitating the
ship's setup. Files are sequentially copied from folder "echosounder" to 
folder "collector" at a user-defined time rate. Any RAW file previously 
present in the collector will be removed before start the copying process.
